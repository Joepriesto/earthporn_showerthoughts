# earthporn_showerthoughts

Download both the Python script and the HTML template
Change the file paths in 'earthporn_showerthoughts.py' for:
  template_path: where you have stored the template (should be the same folder)
  display_path:  where you want the output file (ep_st.html)
  log_path:      where to put the error and event log files.

If desired, set the display_path to somewhere accessible by your webserver, otherwise does not matter
Run the python3 script (from the containing folder: ./earthporn_showerthoughts.py)
Go to the output file, and display it in your webbrowser.

Feel free to tinker with the settings (minSize, number of posts to get, etc...)
